*Collective.addthis* is a simple Plone addon which brings `addthis.com`_ 
services to Plone CMS.

*Collective.addthis* has customizable addthis url (pointing to your AddThis
username) and AddThis javascript url (pointing to addthis javascript url).
By default those settings have random values I got from `addthis.com`_ so
that testing *collective.addthis* would be easy. Those values are recommended
to be changed if you're planning to use this addon in production.

There are few other similar addons for Plone which does the same job with
different approach. If *collective.addthis* doesn't do the job for you I
suggest to check these out too:

* `collective.prettysociable`_
* `collective.plonebookmarklets`_
* `sc.social.bookmarks`_
* `collective.sharerizer`_
